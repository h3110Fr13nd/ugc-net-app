Okay crazy idea hear me out.
My main goal is to pass this exams. Which is a test of mcqs.
I'll create an app that helps me with that. That'll just throw me up some mcqs like real one. Or real ones. If I get it wrong I'll have llm based response with proper explanation. Everything will be saved and recorded. Every question that I answer, dashboards for my average scores running averages the topics that the questions are from my weak spots the weightage everything that will help me understand my weaknesses and work on them.
I'll also add in the real questions manually added in it. By some automation script running.

Help me organize this planning. And invent new ideas in this as well.

I love this idea — it’s like building your **personal UGC NET exam coach app**. Let’s turn your rough concept into an organized roadmap and sprinkle in some smart twists.

---

## 🔑 Core Features

1. **MCQ Engine**

   * Random MCQs from your curated pool (previous years + mock).
   * Option to choose “by topic” or “mixed bag.”
   * Timed vs untimed practice.

2. **Answer & Feedback**

   * Immediate check → Correct / Wrong.
   * If wrong: **LLM-generated explanation** (with examples, mnemonics, memory hacks).
   * Link back to reference (syllabus section / book / notes).

3. **Tracking & Dashboard**

   * Score history (per test, daily, weekly).
   * **Topic-wise performance heatmap** (green = strong, red = weak).
   * Running averages → show if you’re improving.
   * **Confidence scores** (self-marked: “I guessed / I was sure”).

4. **Weakness Drill Mode**

   * App suggests “You keep missing Topic X → Here’s a 20-question drill.”
   * Repetition spaced over time (spaced repetition style).

## ⚡ Automation & Content

* **Scraper / Importer**: Pulls past year questions from PDFs or online sources.
* **Tagging**: Auto-tag questions by unit/topic (with help of LLM).
* **Weightage analysis**: Finds which topics have historically appeared more (useful for prioritization).
* **Question variants**: LLM can rephrase the same question to test deeper understanding.

---

## 📊 Advanced Features

1. **Adaptive Learning Mode**

   * Questions get harder/easier based on your accuracy.
   * Focuses more on your weak spots automatically.

2. **Revision Sprints**

   * “Quick 15 min session” → daily random revision.
   * Flashcards (concept-only, no MCQ) mixed in.

3. **Gamification**

   * Streak counters (days studied).
   * XP points for solving correctly.
   * Leaderboard (if you want to make it multi-user later).

4. **Exam Simulator**

   * Full-length mock test, **exact same pattern & timing as UGC NET**.
   * Reports: rank percentile (if you add friends / global users).

5. **Insights**

   * “You are strong in Paper 2 Unit 3 but weak in Unit 5 → focus there.”
   * “If you improve accuracy in Topic X by 20%, your chances of clearing rise by Y%.”

## 🚀 Crazy Add-ons

* **Voice Mode** → Answer orally, get verbal explanations (like a coach talking to you).
* **Daily AI-generated Summary** → “Yesterday you studied 120 questions, 68% accuracy, best topic: Data Structures, worst topic: Compiler Design.”
* **Time analytics** → Track average time you take per question.
* **AI-generated mnemonics** for topics you keep forgetting.
* **Smart scheduling** → Calendar integration with study plan (daily reminders, upcoming exam countdown).

---

## 🔨 Tech Breakdown

* **Frontend**: Flutter / React Native → mobile-first.
* **Backend**: FastAPI (you already use this) + PostgreSQL for saving data.
* **LLM**: Explanations, auto-tagging, weak spot insights.
* **Dashboard**: Web (React.js) or in-app analytics UI.
* **Automation scripts**: PDF to Question extractor.

👉 This system can evolve from a **personal study assistant** into a **UGC NET prep platform** (you + others → monetization later if you want).

Would you like me to draft this as a **stepwise plan (MVP → Phase 1 → Phase 2)** so you know what to build first vs what’s nice-to-have later?
