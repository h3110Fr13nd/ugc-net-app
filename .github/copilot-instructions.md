# Quick instructions for AI coding agents

Keep guidance short, concrete, and tied to this repository's structure.

- Project type: Flutter app (mobile + desktop + web scaffold). Key files:
  - `pubspec.yaml` — dependencies (english_words, provider) and SDK constraint.
  - `lib/main.dart` — single-entry example app (ChangeNotifier + Provider). Use this as the canonical app flow.
  - `test/widget_test.dart` — example widget test; tests assume the demo counter UI.

- Big picture: This is a starter Flutter app (Namer/App sample). Primary patterns:
  - State: `MyAppState` is a ChangeNotifier provided at top-level via `ChangeNotifierProvider` in `MyApp`.
  - UI: `MyHomePage` is a StatelessWidget that reads state with `context.watch<MyAppState>()`.
  - Naming: Package name in `pubspec.yaml` is `namer_app` but Dart imports use `package:net/...` — respect existing import paths when editing code.

- When modifying UI/state, follow these small conventions found in the codebase:
  - Use Provider and ChangeNotifier for simple app state (see `MyAppState`).
  - Prefer keeping Widgets small and composable; add constructors with `super.key` when needed.
  - Tests follow the Flutter `flutter_test` patterns; update `test/widget_test.dart` when changing main UI labels or buttons.

- Build, run and test commands (developer workflows):
  - Run app (desktop/mobile): `flutter run` (specify `-d <device>` if needed).
  - Run tests: `flutter test`.
  - Get packages: `flutter pub get`.
  - Analyze/lint: `dart analyze` (project contains `analysis_options.yaml` that extends `flutter_lints`).

- Integration and platform notes:
  - Platform folders (android/, ios/, linux/, macos/, windows/, web/) are generated by Flutter. Changes to native config must respect generated plugin registrant files (e.g., `linux/flutter/generated_plugin_registrant.cc`).
  - CI or platform-specific signing is not present in the repo—avoid adding secrets or platform credentials.

- When you change a public symbol, update all imports/usages. Useful search targets: `MyAppState`, `MyHomePage`, `main()`.

- Examples to cite in edits:
  - Read provider state: `var appState = context.watch<MyAppState>();`
  - Access random word: `appState.current.asLowerCase`

- Safety and limits for AI edits:
  - Keep changes minimal and focused per PR (one logical change per branch).
  - Don't modify native platform signing files or local.properties.
  - Preserve generated files under `build/` and platform `flutter/` generated folders.

- If tests fail after edits, run `flutter test --no-pub` to get fast feedback; run `flutter pub get` if dependencies changed.

Please ask for clarification if you need the app to support a specific platform or larger architectural refactor.

Files to watch (high-value files and docs):

- `docs/idea.md` — the product concept and feature brainstorm (your personal exam coach idea). AI agents should consult this before proposing new features.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — phased plan (MVP → Phase 1 → Phase 2) and acceptance criteria; use this for prioritization.
- `lib/main.dart` and `test/widget_test.dart` — canonical app flow and example test.
- `pubspec.yaml` and `analysis_options.yaml` — dependencies and linting rules.
- `scripts/` (future) — data importers and automation scripts; watch for CLI patterns and sample data.
- `backend/` (future) — FastAPI or backend service; watch for API contracts and model changes.
- `build/` and platform folders — generated files should be left untouched (android/, ios/, linux/, macos/, windows/, web/). Treat these as generated artifacts.

When editing, prefer to update `docs/roadmap.md` and `docs/idea.md` before making large architectural changes so reviewers have context.
